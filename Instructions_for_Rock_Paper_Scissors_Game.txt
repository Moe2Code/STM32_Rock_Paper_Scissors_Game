DESCRIPTION FOR THE ROCK PAPER SCISSSORS GAME

Hardware Used:

1- STM32F446RE NUCLEO board, Qty 1
2- STM32F407 DISCOVERY board, Qty 1
3- CAN transceiver (Model number?), Qty 2
4- Light sensor (Model number?), Qty 1
5- UART serial board?, Qty 1
6- Jumper wires (Male to Male (Qty 5), Female to Female (Qty 5), Male to Female (Qty 5))

Software Used:

1- Eclipse based System WorkBench IDE (SW4STM32), version 1.8 or later
2- Tera Term, Version 4.104
3- Board driver for Nucleo and Discovery?

Wiring:

For Nucleo:
1- PA11 --> CAN1_RX and PA12 --> CAN1_TX
2- PA3 --> UART2_RX and PA2 --> UART2_TX
3- PC4 --> Light sensor input

For Discovery:
1- PB8 --> CAN1_RX and PB9 --> CAN1_TX
2- PA3 --> UART2_RX and PA2 --> UART2_TX
3- Replace Jumper JP1 with ammeter to measure current during sleep mode

How the game works:

- This is a game of rock-paper-scissors played between two ST development boards using CAN protocol
- First the two boards, Nucleo and Discovery need to be reset by pressing the reset button on each board. The game can then be started by pressing the user button on Nucleo
- The boards will then pick their hands randomly. Discovery will decide the game result and send it to Nucleo to increment the game score. The score will then be saved into the backup SRAM
- The current game score (stats) can be requested via Discovery's user button. Once received, the game score will be displayed on a Tera Term window along with the time and date kept by the RTC peripheral
- The game features the ability to suspend the game and put both boards in deep sleep mode if the room light is turned off. This is sensed by the light sensor connected to Nucleo. Current consumption drops from 12 mA to 0.6 mA when the boards are in deep sleep mode. 
- The game resumes once room light is on again and Nucleo's wakeup button is pressed. Nucleo's wakeup button also happens to be the board reset button. Current game score will be loaded from the backup SRAM before continuing playing
