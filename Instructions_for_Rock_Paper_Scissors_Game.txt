6- Jumper wires (Male to Male (Qty 10), Female to Female (Qty 10), Male to Female (Qty 10))

Software Used:

1- Eclipse based System WorkBench IDE (SW4STM32), Version 1.8 or later
2- Tera Term, Version 4.104
3- ST-LINK/V2-1 Device Driver (Onboard Programmer and Debugger for Nucleo board)

Wiring:

For Nucleo:
1- PA11 --> CAN1_RX and PA12 --> CAN1_TX
2- PA3 --> UART2_RX and PA2 --> UART2_TX
3- PC4 --> Light sensor input

For Discovery:

3- UART2_RX --> USB-to-UART_TXD and UART2_TX --> USB-to-UART_RXD
3- Replace Jumper JP1 with ammeter to measure current during sleep mode

How the game works:

- This is a game of rock-paper-scissors played between two ST development boards using CAN protocol
- First the corresponding source code needs to be loaded on the IDE, built, and flashed on each board (Nucleo and Discovery)
- The Tera Term window for each board needs to be set to the correct SERIAL PORT and the correct BAUD RATE (115200) in order to view UART messages
- Nucleo and Discovery need to be reset by pressing the reset button on each board. The game can then be started by pressing the user button on Nucleo
- The boards will then pick their hands randomly. Discovery will decide the game result and send it to Nucleo to increment the game score. The score will then be saved into the backup SRAM
- The current game score (stats) can be requested via Discovery's user button. Once received, the game score will be displayed on a Tera Term window along with the time and date kept by the RTC peripheral
- The game features the ability to suspend the game and put both boards in deep sleep mode if the room light is turned off. This is sensed by the light sensor connected to Nucleo. Current consumption drops from 12 mA to 0.6 mA when the boards are in deep sleep mode. 
- The game resumes once room light is on again and Nucleo's wakeup button is pressed. Nucleo's wakeup button also happens to be the board reset button. Current game score will be loaded from the backup SRAM before continuing playing
